Check that the variable is initialized (without obtaining the lock). If it is initialized, return it immediately.
Obtain the lock.
Double-check whether the variable has already been initialized: if another thread acquired the lock first, it may have already done the initialization. If so, return the initialized variable.
Otherwise, initialize and return the variable.
